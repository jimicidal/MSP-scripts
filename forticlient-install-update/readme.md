# Forticlient install/update
This script will check if you have FortiClient installed, find the latest available version number, and install it if necessary. It's meant for Datto RMM in that it checks for a Boolean input variable configured on the component screen in Datto. When you run the component, you can check a box to specify whether you want to automatically suspend BitLocker and reboot now.
