"In scenario A, a worker employed by a company creates a new product or improves upon the business idea. This employee’s direct role, however, is one where they don’t work directly on a product or system that will eventually be patented by the business. In this scenario, the employee technically owns whatever innovation has been created, and the business is afforded a nonexclusive license to use that innovation without paying any royalties to the employee. The employee, however, can license their idea to other businesses independent of the employer. This is the case even if the employee used an employer’s resources to create the product or service improvement."

"The key takeaway here, however, is that employers need to have predefined agreement with all employees regarding intellectual property."
